          This streams live from your browser. Chunks are converted to MPEG-TS
          and then uploaded. If your browser doesn't natively support H.264
          encoding, it needs to transcode the video which can be slow, and on
          slow mahcines might prevent real-time streaming. This mainly means
          Firefox.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the first chunk is uploaded a public stream link will become
          visible. This link can be shared with others to watch the stream. The
          stream uses HLS, which means it doesn't need a special streaming
          server. Everything is powered by Netlify Edge Functions, with the
          chunks stored in Netlify Blob Store.
        </p>
        <p>
          All streams are public, though the URLs are hard to guess. All data is
          kept for one hour before deletion.
